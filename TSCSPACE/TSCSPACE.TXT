* Instructions for Playing
*
* After entering Space Voyage you must enter the TSC
* Random Number Generator at location A04A. Then
* using MIKBUG (a registered trademark of Motorola
* Inc) go to user program at location 0100 hex.
*
* Space Voyage is a very complex space simulation
* game. You are put in command of the Starship
* Enterprise and your mission is to rid the galaxy
* of all enemy Klingon ships. At the start of the
* game you will be informed of the location of your
* starbase. It is important that you know its
* position at all times. Next you must enter a three
* character password. This will be needed if you
* wish to execute the self destruct sequence anytime
* during your mission.
*
* Next, five important lines will be output. First is
* the present stardate followed by the number of
* Klingons in the galaxy. You must destroy all of
* these to save the Federation! The next line tells
* you the number of solar years you will have to
* complete your mission. Finally the last two lines
* inform you of your current quadrant and sector
* locations in the galaxy.
*
* The galaxy is divided into 64 quadrants. See the
* short form instruction sheet for details of the
* coordinates. Each quadrant is similarly divided
* into 64 sectors.
*
* Following is a list of devices and how to use them.
*
*Command 0 - Warp Engines
* Course= An integer number from 0 to 7. The numbers
* start with 0 at the top and go clockwise:
*
*                   0
*                 7   1
*               6       2
*                 5   3
*                   4
*
* Warp Factor= A real number from 0 to 9. If the
* number entered is an integer (no decimal point)
* the distance travelled will be that number of
* quadrants. To travel within a quadrant a decimal
* point must be entered first, then the number of
* sectors travelled equals the number entered after
* the decimal point.
*    Warp .1 = Move  1 Sector
*         .5 =       5 Sectors
*          1 =       1 Quadrant
*          2 =       2 Quadrants
* Example: if you are in quadrant 1-1, sector 1-1
* and enter a course of 2 and warp factor 3 you
* will end up in quadrant 4-1. When you change
* quadrants, the positions of all objects in the
* quadrant (including the Enterprise) will be
* randomized to simulate 3-D travel.
* Note: every use of the warp engines takes time
* and is proportional to the warp factor used.
* If the Enterprise is blocked by something
* during intra-quadrant travel it will stop in
* front of it and waste time. If the object is a
* Klingon, the Klingon will be destroyed and the
* Enterprise badly damaged.
*
*Command 1 - Short Range Scanners
* The short range scanners display a detailed view
* of the current quadrant. The Enterprise looks
* like an 'E' on the screen. Klingons appear as
* a 'K', the starbase as 'B', and stars as '*'. To
* dock with your base, you must first move to one
* of the 8 adjacent sectors then perform a short
* range scan. Docking replenishes all energy, shield
* and photon levels. While docked shields are
* lowered but the base shields protect you. The
* 'condition' displayed on this scan can be 'docked',
* 'green' when no Klingons are threatening, 'red'
* when there are Klingons, and 'yellow' if your
* energy reaches a dangerously low level (300 units
* or less). If condition yellow exists you should
* return to your base immediately!
*
*Command 2 - Long Range Scanners
* These scanners display the objects in the 8
* surrounding quadrants as well as the current
* quadrant. This information is compiled by the
* computer and displayed as a 4 digit number for
* each quadrant.
* The one's digit is the number of Klingons
*     ten's                        stars
*   hundred's                      bases
*   thousand's                     supernovas
* Example: 0121 means no supernovas, 1 base,
* 2 stars, and 1 Klingon.
* A supernova can appear at any time and in any
* quadrant. If it does all objects in that
* quadrant will be destroyed! If the Enterprise
* enters a quadrant containing a supernova, it
* will be destroyed.
*
*Command 3 - Phasers
* Any portion of the available energy can be fired
* using the phasers. The battle computer divides
* this amount among the Klingons of the quadrant
* and determines the various directions of fire.
* Each Klingon has a certain unknown amount of
* energy (each one different) and this is the
* amount needed to destroy them. If too little
* energy is fired you will only damage the Klingons
* and must fire again.
* Note: shields must be lowered to fire phasers.
*
*Command 4 - Photon Torpedoes
* Initially you will have 15 photon torpedoes. One
* torpedo destroys whatever it hits. The range of
* torpedoes (like phasers) is limited to the
* current quadrant. The course of a torpedo is
* set the same way as that of the Enterprise. If
* the torpedo must travel a long distance to its
* target it may run out of energy before reaching
* it.
*
*Command 5 - Damage Report
* The damage report lists the main devices and
* their state of repair. Devices are only listed
* if damaged. The number appearing beside the
* device in the status column indicates the
* number of solar years which must pass before
* that device is repaired. Devices are nonfunctioning
* when damaged. The exception to this is the warp
* engines which may only be used for sector moves.
* Damage can occur any time a Klingon attacks and
* shields are down or when a Klingon is rammed.
* Note: all damages are repaired when docked.
*
*Command 6 and 7 - Energy Shields
* Shield strength is a measure of how much energy
* the shields can ward off during attacks. It is
* printed after shield status during a short range
* scan. When attacked shield strength is lowered
* and the effect is cumulative. When the strength
* reaches zero the shields are disabled and may be
* regained by docking. Command 6 raises the shields
* and uses 200 units of shield energy.
* Command 7 lowers the shields.
*
*Command 8 - Teleporter
* The teleporter instantaneously transports you to
* your base and operates on energy from the base.
* It can be used an unknown number of times but
* not until 12 solar years have passed. After
* any use it may become damaged but will not show
* on the damage report. Any time used it may
* malfunction and place the Enterprise in a random
* quadrant!
*
*Command 9 - Self Destruct
* If you want to give up your mission or decide
* you cant save the Federation you may self
* destruct the Enterprise. Upon entering this
* sequence you will be asked for the password entered
* earlier. Since you are the captain you should be
* the only one with this information. If the wrong
* word is entered the sequence will be aborted,
* otherwise destruction will result!
*
*
* When initializing the game you will be asked
* 'S OR L ?'. This is for short or long version.
* It is recommended that only short versions be
* played at first since long ones tend to be very
* difficult.
*
* When playing it is a good idea to keep track of
* all quadrants seen by the long range scan. This
* lets you keep track of where you have been and
* where the Klingons are located. A sample
* grid for this purpose appears on the short form
* instruction sheet.
*
* Several unexpected events may happen during your
* mission. A space storm will damage your shields.
* Supernovas may appear at any time. Some Klingons
* have the ability to mask themselves from a short
* range scan (but not long range scan). It will
* probably be necessary to use phasers to destroy
* these Klingons. When using your warp engines, if
* you try to leave the galaxy (go beyond the
* stated boundaries) you will be told 'GALAXY
* LIMIT' and halted. If this is attempted three
* times during your mission the Enterprise will be
* destroyed!
*
* --- Good luck on your mission ---
